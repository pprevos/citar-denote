Citar-Denote Manual
*******************

Taking notes about the articles and books is essential to intellectual
life.  Many note-taking systems can connect to a bibliographic database
(such as a plain text BibTeX file or external software such as Zotero).
These databases are helpful when you need to add citations to your
writing.  Electronic bibliographies also help you create and find notes
related to your literature collection and provide access to related
materials, such as online sources and files stored on your computer.

   Citar-Denote integrates the Citar
(https://github.com/emacs-citar/citar) bibliography package with the
Denote note-taking system: *note Denote: (denote)Top. Citar lets you
browse and act on bibliographic data in BibTeX, BibLaTeX or JSON format.
Denote is a versatile Emacs package for taking and managing notes and
associated files.  Combining these two packages enables linking Denote
notes to your bibliography, providing a complete solution for
documenting literature reviews.

1 Principles
************

A bibliographic note is a file that refers to one or more pieces of
literature in your bibliography.  Two types of relationships exist
between your notes and your bibliography:

   • Reference: Relates the whole file to one or more publications (a
     bibliographic note).  Indicated by the reference line in the front
     matter and the ‘bib’ keyword.
   • Citation: A citation inside a note mentions one or more
     publications.  A citation relates a portion of the note's content
     to a publication, *note Org mode citations: (org)Citations.

   The Citar-Denote package maintains a many-to-many relationship
between your notes and your bibliography through references.  Each item
in the bibliography can have one or more notes, and each note can
reference one or more pieces of literature.

   You can create a collection of atomic notes for a single publication
or write a complete literature review assorted references within one
note.  For example, you could write a note about each book chapter or a
single literature review note for a collection of journal articles about
a shared topic.

   The package requires a stable link between the collection of notes
and the bibliography to enable references.  The most common behaviour
for bibliography packages in Emacs is that the filename for the relevant
note includes the citation key to link it to the bibliography (e.g.,
‘marcuse_1969_essay.org’).  However, Denote follows a strict naming
convention, so this approach to linking notes and literature is not
feasible.

   In Citar-Denote, the citation key is part of the front matter of
Denote files through the ‘reference’ line.

   Citar-Denote stores the relationship between citation keys and note
files in a cache.  The package regenerates this cache after you edit a
bibliography file or call any Citar functions.  Each bibliographic note
is marked with the configurable ‘bib’ file tag (‘citar-denote-keyword’).
This tag reduces the search space to generate the cache.

   The front matter for a bibliographic Org mode note looks something
like this:

     #+title:      Marcuse: An Essay on Liberation
     #+date:       [2022-11-12 Sat 19:23]
     #+filetags:   :bib:culture:marketing:philosophy:
     #+identifier: 20221112T192310
     #+reference:  marcuse_1969_essay

   Depending on the size of your digital garden, searching through all
notes for citations can take a moment.  The citations search mechanism
uses the ‘xref’ system.  You can improve the search process by
installing the faster ripgrep (https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
program and setting ‘xref-search-program’ to ‘ripgrep’.

2 Create bibliographic notes
****************************

Open the Citar interface with ‘citar-create-note’.  The letters at the
start of the Citar menu indicate whether the entry has a link (‘L’),
note (‘N’), attachment (‘F’) or is cited in the current buffer (‘C’).
Select the entry you want to create a note for, hit return and follow
the prompts to create a new note.

   If a note already exists, you can open it.  To enable multiple notes
for bibliographic items, set the ‘citar-open-always-create-notes’
variable to ‘t’.

   Various configuration options are available to customise how
Citar-Denote creates bibliographic notes.

File: citar-denote.info,  Node: Default file type,  Next: Bibliographic note title,  Up: Create bibliographic notes

2.1 Default file type
=====================

You can create bibliographic notes for each file type that Denote
supports: Org mode, two Markdown flavours and plain text.

   Citar-Denote uses the default file type set by the ‘denote-file-type’
variable, which you can override with ‘citar-denote-file-type’ to use a
different file type for bibliographic notes.

   Please note that the citations only works in Org mode.  Citation
mechanisms exist for Markdown, but these are not standardised.


File: citar-denote.info,  Node: Bibliographic note title,  Next: Bibliographic keywords,  Prev: Default file type,  Up: Create bibliographic notes

2.2 Bibliographic note title
============================

The default name for a new note is the title of the bibliographic entry.
You can modify this behaviour with the ‘citar-denote-title-format’
variable.  Four options are available:

  1. ‘title’: Extract the title from the bibliographic item (default)
  2. ‘author-year’: Use citation format as "author(s) (year)" (or
     editors when no authors are defined)
  3. ‘author-year-title’: Concatenate the first two options
  4. ‘full’: Full citation of the entry
  5. Fallback option or ‘nil’: The citation key

   For example, using this citation: Coppa, Hass, Peck, Burger (2008)
_Performing Magic on the Western Stage: From the Eighteenth Century to
the Present_, Palgrave Macmillan
<https://doi.org/10.1057/9780230617124>.  The five options result in:

  1. ‘title’: "Performing Magic on the Western Stage: From the
     Eighteenth Century to the Present".
  2. ‘author-year’: "Coppa et al.  (2008)".
  3. ‘author-year-title’: "Coppa et al.  (2008) Performing Magic on the
     Western Stage: From the Eighteenth Century to the Present".
  4. ‘full’: "Coppa, Hass, Peck, Burger (2008) _Performing Magic on the
     Western Stage: From the Eighteenth Century to the Present_,
     Palgrave Macmillan".
  5. ‘nil’: "coppa_2008_perf".

   Using ‘author-year’ for entries allows for some further
configuration.

   For entries with more than one author, you can specify the maximum
number of names with ‘citar-denote-title-format-authors’, which is one
by default.  When the number of defined authors exceeds the number in
the citation, "et al."  is added to the end.  All authors are listed
when this variable exceeds the number of defined authors.

   The default term between authors is "and", which can be changed by
customising ‘citar-denote-title-format-andstr’.

   For example, when using the ‘author-year’ option and up to three
authors and "&" as a connecting term, the title for the example above
becomes "Coppa, Hass & Peck et al.  (2008)."


File: citar-denote.info,  Node: Bibliographic keywords,  Next: Subdirectory,  Prev: Bibliographic note title,  Up: Create bibliographic notes

2.3 Bibliographic keywords
==========================

Every new bibliographic note includes the ‘bib’ file tag.  This tag
minimises the search space when caching notes to accelerate the process.
The ‘citar-denote-keyword’ variable lets you change the tag to something
else.  For example, if your primary language is Welsh, you might want to
change it to ‘llenyddiaeth’ (literature).

   Changing the default keyword requires updating all your bibliographic
notes because the package only recognises a single string.  The
Denote-Explorer package provides a function to rename Denote keywords,
*note Denote-Explorer: (denote-explore)Managing Keywords.

   The ‘citar-denote-use-bib-keywords’ variable includes keywords
defined in the bibliography entry in the note.  When set to ‘t’,
Citar-Denote extracts the available keywords from the BibTeX ‘keywords’
field and uses these as Denote file tags.


File: citar-denote.info,  Node: Subdirectory,  Next: Signature,  Prev: Bibliographic keywords,  Up: Create bibliographic notes

2.4 Subdirectory
================

All new notes are stored in the location specified by
‘denote-directory’.

   If you like storing your bibliographic notes in a subdirectory, set
the ‘citar-denote-subdir’ variable to ‘t’.  Denote now asks for a
subdirectory when creating a new bibliographic note.

   When the content of this variable is a string, Denote saves the note
in a subdirectory with that name under ‘denote-directory’.  For example,
if this variable is set at "literature", all bibliographic notes are
stored under ‘denote-directory/literature/’.  The first time you save a
new note, Emacs will confirm before creating the new directory.


File: citar-denote.info,  Node: Signature,  Next: Create notes using templates,  Prev: Subdirectory,  Up: Create bibliographic notes

2.5 Signature
=============

When the ‘citar-denote-signature’ variable is ‘'ask’, Denote will ask
for a signature when creating a new bibliographic note.

   When this variable is set at ‘'citekey’, the citation key forms the
basis of the signature.  Please note that Denote changes or removes
punctuation in the citation key to enforce compliance with its file
naming convention.

   For example, when the citation key is ‘einstein_1905’, the signature
becomes ‘einstein=2005’.


File: citar-denote.info,  Node: Create notes using templates,  Next: Working with Denote silos,  Prev: Signature,  Up: Create bibliographic notes

2.6 Create notes using templates
================================

Denote includes provisions to create templates for new notes.  You could
use standard headings for bibliographic notes, other headings for meta
notes, or whatever else you might need, *note Denote templates:
(denote)The denote-templates option.

   To include templates in new bibliographic notes, set
‘citar-denote-template’ to either:

   • ‘t’: Ask for a template when creating a note.
   • The name of the default template for creating bibliographic notes

   The example below lets the user choose between a note with two
headings (Abstract and Review) or a plain note without any template
content when ‘citar-denote-template’ is non-nil.  Setting
‘citar-denote-template’ to ‘biblio’ will always use this template for
new literature notes.

     (setq denote-templates
           '((biblio . "* Abstract\n\n* Review\n")
             (plain . nil))
           citar-denote-template 'biblio)


File: citar-denote.info,  Node: Working with Denote silos,  Next: Literature meta notes,  Prev: Create notes using templates,  Up: Create bibliographic notes

2.7 Working with Denote silos
=============================

All Citar-Denote commands detect the current silo and act accordingly,
*note Denote silos: (denote)Maintain separate directory silos for notes.

   A convenience command is available to select a silo before creating a
new bibliographic note.  using ‘citar-denote-create-silo-note’ activates
the extended silo commands in Denote and lets you select a silo defined
in ‘denote-silo-extras-directories’.


File: citar-denote.info,  Node: Literature meta notes,  Prev: Working with Denote silos,  Up: Create bibliographic notes

2.8 Literature meta notes
=========================

If you have a set of notes from the same book and use Org mode, you can
create a meta note to combine the relevant notes.  This note can have
automated links to all related references with dynamic blocks or display
the content of serval notes (transclusion).

   The best way to create a meta note that combines literature notes
from a single publication is to add the citation key in the signature,
as explained above.  You can then use the signature as the regular
expression for the block.  Other options include creating a meta note
for an author or a specific subject matter.  You can use dynamic blocks
if the relevant notes all include the same character string in their
file names, which you can fetch with a regular expression.

   For more information on meta notes, *note Writing metanotes:
(denote)Writing metanotes.

3 Working with existing notes
*****************************

Once you have created some bibliographic notes, you might want to access
and modify them.  You can access the attachments, links and other notes
associated with references from within via the Citar menu
(‘citar-open’).  Entries with a note are indicated with an ‘N’ in the
third column.

* Menu:

* Open existing bibliographic notes::
* Open attachments, links and notes: Open attachments links and notes.
* Open bibliographic entry::
* Add references of convert existing notes to bibliographic notes::
* Remove references from bibliographic notes::


File: citar-denote.info,  Node: Open existing bibliographic notes,  Next: Open attachments links and notes,  Up: Working with existing notes

3.1 Open existing bibliographic notes
=====================================

Two entry points are available to find notes related to literature,
either as references or as citations.

   Use ‘citar-denote-open-note’ to open the Citar menu with only entries
with one or more associated notes.  Select your target and hit Return.

   Citar provides a list of resources for the selected entry:
attachments, existing notes, links and an option to create an additional
note.  Select the note you seek, hit Return again and select the Denote
file you want to open.

   The previous function shows all literature with one or more
bibliographic note(s) linked through a reference line.  The
‘citar-denote-find-citation’ function lists all bibliographic entries
cited inside your Denote collection, from which you can open the
relevant note.  When only one note cites the selected entry, this file
is opened.  When multiple files cite the chosen entry, you must pick
which file to jump to.

   By default, this function only looks at citations in your document.
Setting the ‘citar-denote-cite-includes-reference’ to non-nil includes
references.

   When using the ‘citar-embark’ package, you can activate this function
after you create a keyboard shortcut:

   ‘(define-key citar-embark-map "d" 'citar-denote-find-citation)’


File: citar-denote.info,  Node: Open attachments links and notes,  Next: Open bibliographic entry,  Prev: Open existing bibliographic notes,  Up: Working with existing notes

3.2 Open attachments, links and notes
=====================================

The ‘citar-denote-dwim’ function provides access to the Citar menu, from
where you can open attachments, other notes, and links related to the
citation references associated with the current Denote buffer.

   Select the required bibliographic item when there is more than one
reference.  You can then select the attachment, link, or note you would
like to access and hit Return, after which you will choose your link,
note, or attachment.  Alternatively, you can also create a new note for
that reference.


File: citar-denote.info,  Node: Open bibliographic entry,  Next: Add references of convert existing notes to bibliographic notes,  Prev: Open attachments links and notes,  Up: Working with existing notes

3.3 Open bibliographic entry
============================

The ‘citar-denote-open-reference-entry’ function opens the bibliographic
entry (BibTeX, BibLaTeX or CSL file) for a selected reference, from
where you can edit the bibliographic data.


File: citar-denote.info,  Node: Add references of convert existing notes to bibliographic notes,  Next: Remove references from bibliographic notes,  Prev: Open bibliographic entry,  Up: Working with existing notes

3.4 Add references of convert existing notes to bibliographic notes
===================================================================

The ‘citar-denote-add-reference’ command adds one or more citation keys
to the reference line.  This command converts an existing Denote file to
a bibliographic note when no existing reference line exists.  When
converting a regular Denote file, the function adds the
‘citar-denote-keyword’ to the front matter and renames the file
accordingly.

   Using the universal argument ‘C-u’ lets you select entries that are
not yet referenced or cited in your Denote files.


File: citar-denote.info,  Node: Remove references from bibliographic notes,  Prev: Add references of convert existing notes to bibliographic notes,  Up: Working with existing notes

3.5 Remove references from bibliographic notes
==============================================

You remove citation references with the ‘citar-denote-remove-citekey’
command.  Suppose the current buffer references more than one piece of
literature.  In that case, you must select the unwanted item in the
minibuffer.

   When no more reference items are left, the ‘_bib’ keyword is removed,
and the file is renamed.

   You can also manually edit your file and add and remove reference
citation keys.

4 Relationships between bibliographic notes
*******************************************

Bibliographic notes rarely exist in solitude.  A note might be one of a
series about the same topic or about the same book.

   The ‘citar-denote-find-reference’ function finds all notes where
another note cites the selected reference from the active buffer.  A
warning appears in the minibuffer when the selected reference is not
found in any Denote files or you are not in a Denote file.

   If you would like to know whether one of the references in the
current buffer is also referenced in another note, then use
‘citar-denote-dwim’, discussed above.

   Denote has excellent capabilities for linking notes to each other.
You can use this facility to link to any other bibliographic note in
your collection.  The ‘citar-denote-link-reference’ function asks you to
select a bibliographic entry for which a note exists.  It then creates a
link to the relevant note in the current Denote buffer.  If more than
one note exists for the selected publication, you first choose which
note you like to link to.


File: citar-denote.info,  Node: Citation management,  Next: Quality Assurance,  Prev: Relationships between bibliographic notes,  Up: Top

5 Citation management
*********************

What is the point of building a bibliography without using each entry as
a citation or a reference in a bibliographic note?  These last two
commands let you cite literature or create a new bibliographic note for
any item not used in your Denote collection.

   The ‘citar-denote-nocite’ function opens the Citar menu.  It shows
all items in your bibliography that are neither cited nor referenced.
From there, you can create a new bibliographic note, follow a link or
read the associated file(s).  If your Denote collection references or
cites all items in your bibliography, a message appears in the
minibuffer: "No associated resources".

   The ‘citar-denote-cite-nocite’ function cites any unused
bibliographic items.  This function only works when the active buffer is
a Denote Org mode note.

   Lastly, the ‘citar-denote-nobib’ function lists all references and
citations in your Denote collection that are absent in the global
bibliography in the ‘*Messages*’ buffer.  Note that this list excludes
any local bibliographies.  The output of this function is a list of
citation keys used in Denote that need to be added or corrected.

   Please note that these functions only recognises citations in Org
files.

6 Quality Assurance
*******************

The ‘citar-denote-check-keywords’ function reviews all Denote notes and
does the following:

   • Remove bib keyword when no reference, but ‘citar-denote-keyword’ is
     present.
   • Add bib keyword when refenece is present, but
     ‘citar-denote-keyword’ is missing.

   The ‘citar-denote-nobib’ command lists all citations referenced or
cited in Denote, but not present in the bibliography.

7 Installation and example configuration
****************************************

This package is available in MELPA.  The example below provides a
minimum configuration for both Citar and Denote.  The minimum required
configuration for Citar is to set the list of bibliography files.  Using
Org mode citations, you can set this variable the same as
‘org-cite-global-bibliography’.  This configuration also sets Citar to
accept multiple notes per reference.

     (use-package citar
       :ensure t
       :defer t
       :custom
       ;; set bibliography's location
       (citar-bibliography '("~/documents/library/magic-tricks.bib"))
       ;; Allow multiple notes per bibliographic entry
       (citar-open-always-create-notes nil)
       :init
       (fido-vertical-mode 1)
       :bind ("C-c w c" . citar-create-note))

     (use-package denote
       :defer t
       :custom
       (denote-directory "~/documents/notes"))

   The citar-Denote configuration includes all configurable variables
with their package defaults.  You can either remove these entries or
configure them to your preferences.  This configuration example also
binds all available Citar-Denote commands.  You will need to change the
directory paths to suit your preferences.

     (use-package citar-denote
     :ensure t
     :demand t ;; Ensure minor mode loads
     :after (:any citar denote)
     :custom
     ;; Package defaults
     (citar-denote-file-type 'org)
     (citar-denote-keyword "bib")
     (citar-denote-signature nil)
     (citar-denote-subdir nil)
     (citar-denote-template nil)
     (citar-denote-title-format "title")
     (citar-denote-title-format-andstr "and")
     (citar-denote-title-format-authors 1)
     (citar-denote-use-bib-keywords nil)
     :preface
     (bind-key "C-c w n" #'citar-denote-open-note)
     :init
     (citar-denote-mode)
     ;; Bind all available commands
     :bind (("C-c w d" . citar-denote-dwim)
            ("C-c w e" . citar-denote-open-reference-entry)
            ("C-c w a" . citar-denote-add-citekey)
            ("C-c w k" . citar-denote-remove-citekey)
            ("C-c w r" . citar-denote-find-reference)
            ("C-c w l" . citar-denote-link-reference)
            ("C-c w f" . citar-denote-find-citation)
            ("C-c w x" . citar-denote-nocite)
            ("C-c w y" . citar-denote-cite-nocite)
            ("C-c w z" . citar-denote-nobib)))

   You can use the standard configurations for Citar and Denote.
Citar-Denote takes over the note-taking functionality in Citar with a
minor mode.

   You can also install this package directly from GitHub to enjoy the
latest version (assuming you use Emacs 29 or above.

     (unless (package-installed-p 'citar-denote)
     (package-vc-install
      '(citar-denote
        :url "https://github.com/pprevos/citar-denote/")))
